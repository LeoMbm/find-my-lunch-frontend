# Find My Lunch React 

This is my real first React's project.

I decided to use React to be able to benefit from the dynamic side that this library offers and also learn along the way.


## Known Issues
 - Authentication should be done in the backend but i need to retrieve the session and put this in session storage
 - Keep User logged in after refreshing page
 - Log value when address is clicked and retrieve long lat for geocoder
 - Retrieve user info for header dropdown. I dont know why i cant do this.
