# Find My Lunch React 

This is my real first React's project.

I decided to use React to be able to benefit from the dynamic side that this library offers and also learn along the way.

    - Everybody can login/register
    - Everybody can see restaurants around him

### Features

    - User can cancel his order before the delivery

    - Add review for restaurants



## Known Issues
 - Log value when address is clicked and retrieve long lat for geocoder
